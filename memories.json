Uses TypeScript/Bun runtime with TUI (Terminal User Interface) in Go\n3. Core: Modified OpenCode targeting n8n workflow JSON generation\n4. System prompts drive AI behavior specifically for n8n workflows\n5. Super Code node with 46 pre-loaded JavaScript libraries in VM safe environment\n6. Multi-language: TypeScript core, Go TUI, cloud infrastructure with SST\n\nSCALABILITY CONCERNS:\n1. Single-user focused design - no multi-tenancy architecture\n2. Local file system storage (app.json, memories.json) \n3. No database layer for user/session/workflow management\n4. Limited cloud infrastructure (appears to be proof-of-concept)\n5. TUI-centric design doesn't scale to web/API use cases\n6. No authentication/authorization system for multi-user scenarios\n\nINTEGRATION RISKS:\n1. Hardcoded n8n node type references (@kenkaiii/n8n-nodes-supercode.superCodeNodeVmSafe)\n2. Static library list in Super Code node - no dynamic loading\n3. Direct JSON workflow generation without n8n API integration\n4. No validation against n8n schema versions\n5. No automated testing of generated workflows\n\nARCHITECTURAL STRENGTHS:\n1. Provider-agnostic AI models (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, local)\n2. Modular tool system (bash, edit, grep, glob, etc.)\n3. Strong TypeScript foundations with proper error handling\n4. Client/server separation allows for future remote usage\n5. MCP (Model Context Protocol) integration for extensibility",

PHASE 1 (Weeks 1-4): Fix reliability crisis with validation pipeline, automated testing, security hardening\n2. PHASE 2 (Weeks 5-12): Expand from Super Code only to 50+ n8n node types, multi-user architecture  \n3. PHASE 3 (Weeks 13-20): Enhanced UX, advanced features, enterprise security\n\nCRITICAL BLOCKERS:\n- High failure risk in JavaScript generation without validation\n- Single-user architecture with no scalability path\n- Only handles 1 of 400+ n8n node types\n\nINVESTMENT: Proceed with caution - requires 2-3 developers for 5 months to reach production readiness.

During build, TUI binary is embedded via KEN8N_CODER_TUI_PATH define  \n2. On Mac, the embedded binary path should be something like \"../../../dist/ken8n-coder-darwin-x64/bin/tui\"\n3. But line 50 shows: `await $'rm -rf ./dist/${name}/bin/tui'` - TUI binary is DELETED after build!\n4. This means embeddedFiles has NO TUI binary, resolveTuiBinary() falls back to \"go run ./main.go\"\n5. \"go run\" mode lacks the proper Node.js backend integration that provides tools!\n\nSOLUTION: Fix build process to keep TUI binary in embedded files for runtime use.",

Updated bin/setup.js: Now generates claude_mcp.json configuration with environment variables instead of saving to ~/.mcp-n8n/config.json\n3. Updated package.json: Fixed bin entry for NPX compatibility\n4.

Missing file-based workflow management strategy\n\nRECOMMENDED APPROACH:\n1. Add workflow file management section\n2. Change deployment to: Create file → Read file → Deploy\n3. Add update strategy: Edit file → Read → Deploy full workflow\n4. Include ./n8n-workflows/ directory structure\n5. Emphasize file persistence for version control and editing\n6. Keep Super Code philosophy but add file-based workflow\n\nKEY CHANGES NEEDED:\n- Line 165: Remove \"NO local .json files\"\n- Add section on workflow file management\n- Update deployment process to include file creation\n- Add update process using file editing\n- Explain why file-based is better (n8n API limitation)",

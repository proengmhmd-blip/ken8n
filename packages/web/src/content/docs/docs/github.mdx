description: Use opencode in GitHub issues and pull-requests
---

opencode integrates with your GitHub workflow. Mention `/opencode` or `/oc` in your comment, and opencode will execute tasks within your GitHub Actions runner.

---

## Features

- **Triage issues**: Ask opencode to look into an issue and explain it to you.
- **Fix and implement**: Ask opencode to fix an issue or implement a feature. And it will work in a new branch and submits a PR with all the changes.
- **Secure**: opencode runs inside your GitHub's runners.

---

## Installation

Run the following command in a project that is in a GitHub repo:

```bash
opencode github install
```

This will walk you through installing the GitHub app, creating the workflow, and setting up secrets.

---

### Manual Setup

Or you can set it up manually.

1. **Install the GitHub app**

   Head over to [**github.com/apps/opencode-agent**](https://github.com/apps/opencode-agent). Make sure it's installed on the target repository.

2. **Add the workflow**

   Add the following workflow file to `.github/workflows/opencode.yml` in your repo. Make sure to set the appropriate `model` and required API keys in `env`.

   ```yml title=".github/workflows/opencode.yml" {24,26}
   name: opencode

   on:
     issue_comment:
       types: [created]

   jobs:
     opencode:
       if: |
         contains(github.event.comment.body, '/oc') ||
         contains(github.event.comment.body, '/opencode')
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest
       permissions:
         id-token: write
       steps:
         - name: Checkout repository
           uses: actions/checkout@v4
           with:
             fetch-depth: 1

         - name: Run opencode
           uses: sst/opencode/github@latest
           env:
             ANTHROPIC_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}
           with:
             model: anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-20250514
             # share: true
   ```

3. **Store the API keys in secrets**

   In your organization or project **settings**, expand **Secrets and variables** on the left and select **Actions**. And add the required API keys.

---

## Configuration

- `model`: The model used by opencode. Takes the format of `provider/model`. This is **required**.
- `share`: Share the session. Sessions are shared by default for public repos.

---

## Examples

Here are some examples of how you can use opencode in GitHub.

- **Explain an issue**

  Add this comment in a GitHub issue.

  ```
  /opencode explain this issue
  ```

  opencode will read the entire thread, including all comments, and reply with a clear explanation.

- **Fix an issue**

  In a GitHub issue, say:

  ```
  /opencode fix this
  ```

  And opencode will create a new branch, implement the changes, and open a PR with the changes.

- **Review PRs and make changes**

  Leave the following comment on a GitHub PR.

  ```
  Delete the attachment from S3 when the note is removed /oc
  ```

  opencode will implement the requested change and commit it to the same PR.

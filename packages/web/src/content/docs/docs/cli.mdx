<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Linux/macOS">
    ```bash export EDITOR=nano # or vim, code, etc. ``` To make it permanent, add this to your shell profile;
    `~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`, etc.
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Windows (CMD)">
    ```bash set EDITOR=notepad # or code, vim, etc. ``` To make it permanent, use **System Properties** > **Environment
    Variables**.
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Windows (PowerShell)">
    ```bash $env:EDITOR = "notepad" # or "code", "vim", etc. ``` To make it permanent, add this to your PowerShell
    profile.
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Commands

The opencode CLI also has the following commands.

---

### agent

Manage agents for opencode.

```bash
opencode agent [command]
```

---

#### create

Create a new agent with custom configuration.

```bash
opencode agent create
```

This command will guide you through creating a new agent with a custom system prompt and tool configuration.

---

### auth

Command to manage credentials and login for providers.

```bash
opencode auth [command]
```

---

#### login

opencode is powered by the provider list at [Models.dev](https://models.dev), so you can use `opencode auth login` to configure API keys for any provider you'd like to use. This is stored in `~/.local/share/opencode/auth.json`.

```bash
opencode auth login
```

When opencode starts up it loads the providers from the credentials file. And if there are any keys defined in your environments or a `.env` file in your project.

---

#### list

Lists all the authenticated providers as stored in the credentials file.

```bash
opencode auth list
```

Or the short version.

```bash
opencode auth ls
```

---

#### logout

Logs you out of a provider by clearing it from the credentials file.

```bash
opencode auth logout
```

---

### github

Manage the GitHub agent for repository automation.

```bash
opencode github [command]
```

---

#### install

Install the GitHub agent in your repository.

```bash
opencode github install
```

This sets up the necessary GitHub Actions workflow and guides you through the configuration process. [Learn more](/docs/github).

---

#### run

Run the GitHub agent. This is typically used in GitHub Actions.

```bash
opencode github run
```

##### Flags

| `--token` | GitHub personal access token           |

---

### models

List all available models from configured providers.

```bash
opencode models
```

This command displays all models available across your configured providers in the format `provider/model`.

---

### run

Run opencode in non-interactive mode by passing a prompt directly.

```bash
opencode run [message..]
```

This is useful for scripting, automation, or when you want a quick answer without launching the full TUI. For example.

```bash "opencode run"
opencode run Explain the use of context in Go
```

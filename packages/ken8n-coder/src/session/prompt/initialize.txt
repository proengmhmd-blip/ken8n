Please analyze this n8n workspace and create an AGENTS.md file containing:
1. n8n workflow validation/testing commands - especially for importing and testing workflows
2. n8n workflow guidelines including JSON structure, node configurations, Super Code JavaScript patterns, naming conventions, credential handling, etc.

The file you create will be given to agentic n8n workflow creation agents (such as yourself) that operate in this workspace. Make it about 20 lines long.
If there are existing workflow patterns (in workflows/ or .n8n/) or n8n configuration files, make sure to include them.

If there's already an AGENTS.md, improve it if it's located in ${path}
